Welcome to Xapian's Learning to Rank Framework
==============================================

Xapian's build system is built using GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool.
If you've installed other Open Source projects from source, you should
find yourself in familiar territory.  Building and installing involves
the following 3 simple steps:

 1) Run "./bootstrap xapian-core xapian-letor" in the top level directory.
    Note: It is preferred that you bootstrap all of the xapian project together.
    To do that, run:
    "./bootstrap xapian-core xapian-applications/omega swig xapian-bindings xapian-letor"
 2) Run "./configure", possibly with some extra arguments
 3) Run "make" to build
 4) Run "make install" to install

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need to install the following prerequisites before you can
build xapian-letor:

 * xapian-core: We recommend using matching versions of xapian-core and
   xapian-letor.  If you install xapian-core from a package, make sure you
   also install the development files which are often packaged separately
   (e.g. in libxapian-dev or xapian-core-devel).
